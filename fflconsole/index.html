      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      FFLConsole attempts to be a clean, open-source, asethestically pleasing way to make sense of
      fantasy football facts and figures. I haven't put much time into designing the webpage.
      Instead, I've put time into developing the system itself. I've licensed the source code
      to this repository under the 
      <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html">GPL Version 2 license</a>.
      
      <h1>How To Contribute</h1>
      If you are a programmer and know how to use git, you can contribute to the repository

      Otherwise, you can send me an email at clay.l.mcleod@gmail.com with your feedback.
